# Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch: A Hands-On Guide

This repository offers a step-by-step implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch. The notebook, **Building a CNN in PyTorch**, explores CNN architecture and its application to image data classification, providing foundational knowledge for working with deep learning models.

## Contents

- **CNN Architecture**: Learn about building and training a CNN from scratch, with convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Image Dataset**: Leverages a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST) to demonstrate the model's learning process.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Walk through training, validation, and evaluation to understand the modelâ€™s performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started
